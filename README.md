# Konnect - Connecting Tutors with Students
Welcome to Konnect, a platform designed to bridge the gap between tutors and students, making learning accessible and personalized. This project is built using React, Firebase and Tailwind, offering a seamless experience for both tutors looking to share their knowledge and students eager to learn.

```npm install```
This command will download and install all the dependencies listed in package.json, setting up your environment for development.

### Starting the Development Server
